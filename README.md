# Fawry Internship Challenge â€“ E-Commerce System

This repository contains my solution to the Fawry Rise Journey Full Stack Development Internship challenge.

##Overview

The task was to design and implement a simple yet robust **e-commerce system** using Java with the following features:

- Define multiple product types (perishable, shippable, etc.)
- Allow customers to add products to a cart and proceed to checkout
- Handle expiry, stock limits, and balance validation
- Process shipping for eligible items
- Print clean, formatted checkout and shipment summaries

I implemented the entire system in raw Java with no frameworks, to focus on solid **OOP design**, **clean code**

##What I Focused On

- Using clean and readable object-oriented design
- Covering edge cases like:
  - Expired items
  - Insufficient stock
  - Empty cart
  - Insufficient balance

# IDE used was intellij idea
